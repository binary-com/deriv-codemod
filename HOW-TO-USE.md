## Installation

`deriv-codemod` requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14+ to run.

To install globally:

```sh
npm i -g deriv-codemod
```

## Usage

`Prerequisite`: Before running the codemod please make sure your git is in a clean slate and there are no local changes

Just run the below command to get started.

```sh
deriv-codemod
```

#### Step 1:

Once you run the command, it will ask you for the source file/files path where you want to run codmod. It can be an absolute path or relative path.

Path examples:
 - To select single file:  ./packages/p2p/src/components/user/user-avatar/user-avatar.jsx
 - To select multiple files: ./packages/p2p/**/*.jsx

`deriv-codemod` uses [fast-glob](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob) internally to match file/files. You can check out [fast-glob](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob) documentation for more match syntax.

Choose the codemod that you want to run. You can simply navigate with your arrow keys and press `Enter` to select.

Here, we selected `Change extension` codemod and keyed in `tsx` as new extension.

Once the codemod ran successfully, make sure to commit the changes to get better git diff.

Rerun `deriv-codemod` and pass the path where you want to run the `Convert proptypes to TS` codemod.

Note: Please make sure to pass in the new path after you changed the extension. Since we changed the extension to `tsx`, we are passing the path with `.tsx` extension.
Path examples:
 - To select single file:  ./packages/p2p/src/components/user/user-avatar/user-avatar.tsx
 - To select multiple files: ./packages/p2p/**/*.tsx

After that, select `Convert proptypes to TS` codemod.
